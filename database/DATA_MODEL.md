# Zorfly Production Data Model

## 1. Conventions

This catalogue documents every model in `schema.prisma`. The schema file is
authoritative for exact types, nullability, indexes, uniqueness, and
referential actions.

### Common fields

Unless the entity is explicitly platform-global, each row includes mandatory
`tenantId`. Tenant-owned mutable definitions also include:

- UUID `id`;
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`;
- `createdById`, `updatedById` where actor attribution is meaningful;
- `deletedAt`, `deletedById` for soft deletion;
- integer `rowVersion` for optimistic concurrency; and
- lifecycle/status fields where archival differs from deletion.

Actor audit IDs are stable UUID values without destructive foreign keys so
historical attribution survives identity anonymization/deletion. Important
changes are additionally written to append-only `AuditEvent`.

Published versions and evidence/ledger/history rows are immutable and use
append/supersede/correct patterns rather than soft delete. High-volume tables
use locality-friendly bigint IDs plus UUID public IDs where externally
addressable.

### Tenant safety

RLS is mandatory on every table with `tenantId`. Custom migration SQL adds
tenant-consistent composite foreign keys, checks for polymorphic targets, and
forced RLS. Platform-global exceptions are: `User`, `Permission`,
`PlatformRole`, `PlatformRolePermission`, `PlatformUserRole`,
`SubscriptionPlan`, `PlanEntitlement`, `QuestionType`, `RewardType`,
`AIProvider`, and `AIModel`.

## 2. Platform identity, reference data, and billing

| Entity | Purpose | Fields | Relationships | Business rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `User` | Global human identity projection, independent of any tenant | external subject, canonical email, display/locale/time-zone data, operator flag, auth timestamp | Has tenant memberships, platform roles, support grants | Authentication data is external; deletion anonymizes identity while evidence retains actor UUID |
| `Permission` | Atomic authorization action catalogue | immutable key, description, risk level | Used by tenant and platform role-permission joins | Keys are global, stable, deny-by-default, and never wildcard grants |
| `PlatformRole` | Platform operator responsibility | key, name, description | Has permissions and user assignments | Does not grant tenant-content access; support grant is separate |
| `PlatformRolePermission` | Platform role-to-permission join | role ID, permission ID, timestamps | Belongs to role and permission | Composite unique primary key; changes audited |
| `PlatformUserRole` | Time-bound platform role assignment | user ID, role ID, grant actor, expiry | Belongs to user and platform role | Expired assignment conveys no authority |
| `SubscriptionPlan` | Commercial plan catalogue | code, name, currency, monthly/annual amount, status | Has entitlements and subscriptions | Global soft-deletable reference; financial changes use new effective plan/version operationally |
| `PlanEntitlement` | Feature/limit within a plan | feature key, enabled flag, numeric limit, JSON config | Belongs to subscription plan | Unique feature per plan; absence means not entitled |
| `QuestionType` | Global interaction/answer schema | key, name, JSON answer schema, auto-score/media flags, status | Used by question versions | Stable keys; incompatible answer formats require new type/schema version |
| `RewardType` | Global reward classification | key, name, description, status | Types tenant catalogue items | No fulfillment secrets or tenant-specific policy |
| `TenantSubscription` | Tenant's plan contract period | external subscription ID, status, period dates, cancellation/end | Belongs to tenant and plan; has invoices | One active effective subscription is enforced by partial unique migration/index |
| `Invoice` | Immutable tenant billing obligation snapshot | external ID, number, status, currency, subtotal/tax/total, due/paid times | Belongs to tenant/subscription; has payments | Tenant invoice number unique; paid financial facts corrected with adjustments |
| `Payment` | Payment-provider transaction evidence | external ID, status, amount/currency, provider, paid/failure data | Belongs to tenant and invoice | Append/reconcile; total successful payments may not exceed invoice plus approved adjustments |

## 15. Cross-entity business invariants

1. Published content is immutable and every delivered paper pins exact versions.
2. Official score is derived only from authoritative evaluations and manual
   review decisions, not directly from mutable content or AI history.
3. Candidate and employee principals are distinct; conversion to employment
   creates a membership through an audited workflow.
4. Object bytes live in private object storage; database rows retain immutable
   checksums, version, lineage, moderation, and provenance.
5. Analytics, leaderboard, and aggregate tables are rebuildable projections and
   never the authoritative evidence source.
6. Ledgers and histories append corrections; destructive delete is limited to
   approved retention/purge operations.
7. Every asynchronous side effect starts from `OutboxEvent`, and every external
   mutation uses an idempotency key.
